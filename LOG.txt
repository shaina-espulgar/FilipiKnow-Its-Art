to fix the UI since I ruined most of them when coding. 
- Host and Client can now see each other, "ready-unready" function now working.
Please Note: Place all of the Actual Gameplay inside the "GamePlay" scene. 
Test it on Android first since I just test the LAN multiplayer in PC because it is hard to test it in Android.
